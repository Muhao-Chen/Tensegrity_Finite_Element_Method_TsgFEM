This folder contains five dynamic examples to demonstrate the capability of TsgFEM. 

1. '01_tower' is the dynamic analysis of a two-layer tensegrity prism in forced ground motion. (As an example to show, TsgFEM can deal with any boundary conditions.)

2. '02_cantilever_truss' is the dynamic analysis of a truss in different material properties.  (As an example to show TsgFEM analysis for structure with any elastic/plastic materials.)

3. '03_double_pendulum' is the dynamic analysis of a double pendulum in gravity force. The TsgFEM result is compared with the analytical solution. (As an example to compare with rigid body dynamics.)

4. '04_Lander' is a landing and bouncing analysis of an expanded octahedron tensegrity. (As an example to show, TsgFEM allows the structure to interact with ground dynamics.)

5. '05_T_bar_Dynamics' is the dynamic analysis of a planner T-Bar structure with an initial velocity. (As an example to show that structure can work with any initial velocities of structures nodes. )
